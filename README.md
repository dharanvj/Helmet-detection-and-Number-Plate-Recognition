# Helmet-detection-and-Number-Plate-Recognition
Its a simple YOLO model to detect and count the number of people wearing helmet in a image. this model can be used to detect the intrusion or to find the people ridding bike without helmet
This code is very simple and with the help of little manipulation, you can count the number of detection for a particular detection. or extract the co-ordinates of bounding boxes. download the models, create necessary files and give full path to the models and folder names and run the python sc
